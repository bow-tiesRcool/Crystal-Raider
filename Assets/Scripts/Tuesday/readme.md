# Tuesday (Tiled Unity Editor, Serializer, Deserializer, and You)

Tuesday is a generic C# Tiled (.tmx) serializer and deserializer and a set of Unity editor scripts that allow you to drag and drop TMX files into your scene, make edits, and save back out as TMX files.

The goals of this project are full support of the TMX file format, feature parity with the standalone Tiled map editor, and minimal dependencies.
